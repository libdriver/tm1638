## LibDriver TM1638

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/tm1638/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

TM1638 is an IC dedicated to LED (light emitting diode display) drive control and equipped with a keypad scan interface. It integrates MCU digital interface, data latch, LED drive, and keypad scanning circuit. This product is reliable in quality, stable in performance and strong in interference resistance. It is mainly used for household electrical appliances (smart water heaters, microwave ovens, washing machines, air conditioners, electric stove), set-top boxes, electronic scale, smart meters and other digital tube or LED display devices.

LibDriver TM1638 is a full-featured driver for TM1638, launched by LibDriver. It provides digital tube display, keypad scanning and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/interface includes LibDriver TM1638 SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver TM1638 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver TM1638 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver TM1638 offline document.

/datasheet includes TM1638 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_tm1638_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t segk[4];
uint16_t number[] = {TM1638_NUMBER_0, TM1638_NUMBER_1, TM1638_NUMBER_2,
                     TM1638_NUMBER_3, TM1638_NUMBER_4, TM1638_NUMBER_5,
                     TM1638_NUMBER_6, TM1638_NUMBER_7, TM1638_NUMBER_8, TM1638_NUMBER_9};

/* init */
res = tm1638_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* write */
res = tm1638_basic_write(0x00, number, 8);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tm1638_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* read */
res = tm1638_basic_read(segk);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tm1638_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

/* output */
tm1638_interface_debug_print("tm1638: segk[0]: 0x%02X.\n", segk[0]);
tm1638_interface_debug_print("tm1638: segk[1]: 0x%02X.\n", segk[1]);
tm1638_interface_debug_print("tm1638: segk[2]: 0x%02X.\n", segk[2]);
tm1638_interface_debug_print("tm1638: segk[3]: 0x%02X.\n", segk[3]);

...
    
/* on */
res = tm1638_basic_display_on();
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tm1638_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* off */
res = tm1638_basic_display_off();
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tm1638_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* deinit */
res = tm1638_basic_deinit();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

return 0;
```
